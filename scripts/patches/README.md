# Custom Patches

These patch files are temporary and used by [core-patches.sh](../core-patches.sh) for situations where new core PRs may conflict.
Additionally patches may be used for emergent situations at high volume. 
This is only used if building using [build-dist.sh](build-dist.sh) with it's custom patches/sha/theme/plugins as used by DMS.
